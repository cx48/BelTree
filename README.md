# BelTree Site - Production Build

This branch contains the production build files generated using `zola build`. All files and folders are located within the `public/` directory, which is essential for hosting your static site.

The purpose of this branch is to showcase [BelTree](https://cx48.github.io/BelTree/) using GitHub Pages. The static files in the `public/` folder are ready for deployment and can be served directly.
